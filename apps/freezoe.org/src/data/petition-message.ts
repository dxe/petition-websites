export const DEFAULT_MESSAGE = `Dear Governor Newsom,

I am writing to urge you to immediately pardon Zoe Rosenberg, a 23-year-old UC Berkeley student and lifelong animal advocate, who was convicted and incarcerated in Sonoma County for an act of compassion. She has already spent time in jail and is now on house arrest. 

Zoe rescued four sick and suffering chickens, who she named Poppy, Aster, Ivy, and Azalea, from Petaluma Poultry, a Perdue-owned slaughterhouse in Petaluma, California. The hens were provided with urgent veterinary care and are now living safe and happy at an animal sanctuary. Instead of addressing the well-documented animal cruelty at Petaluma Poultry, authorities have chosen to punish Zoe for exposing the truth.

This is not justice. This is criminalizing compassion.

Beyond the injustice of the charges, Zoe's incarceration posed a grave threat to her life. She lives with Type 1 Diabetes and serious complications, including gastroparesis. These conditions require continuous access to medication and regular medical oversight. Sonoma County authorities dismissed these concerns, demonstrating their zealous overprosecution of a nonviolent activist.

Governor Newsom, you have the power to intervene. We call on you to pardon Zoe Rosenberg, and direct the Sonoma County District Attorney to prosecute the animal cruelty at Petaluma Poultry, not animal rescuers.

Sincerely,

[Your name]

[Your city]
