export const DEFAULT_MESSAGE = `Dear Governor Newsom,

I am writing to urge you to immediately pardon and release Zoe Rosenberg, a 23-year-old UC Berkeley student and lifelong animal advocate, who is currently incarcerated in Sonoma County's Main Adult Detention Facility for an act of compassion. 

Zoe rescued four sick and suffering chickens, who she named Poppy, Aster, Ivy, and Azalea, from Petaluma Poultry, a Perdue-owned slaughterhouse in Petaluma, California. The hens were provided with urgent veterinary care and are now living safe and happy at an animal sanctuary. Instead of addressing the well-documented animal cruelty at Petaluma Poultry, authorities have chosen to punish Zoe for exposing the truth.

This is not justice. This is criminalizing compassion.

Beyond the injustice of the charges, Zoe's incarceration poses a grave threat to her life. She lives with Type 1 Diabetes and serious complications, including gastroparesis. These conditions require continuous access to medication and regular medical oversight. Without this care, Zoe faces the risk of dangerous complications or even death while in custody.

Governor Newsom, you have the power to intervene. We call on you to pardon Zoe Rosenberg, ensure her immediate release from custody so she can access the medical care her life depends on, and direct the Sonoma County District Attorney to prosecute the animal cruelty at Petaluma Poultry, not animal rescuers. 

Sincerely,

[Your name]

[Your city]
